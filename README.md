# Prediction-of-Price-Categories-using-Classification

## Source

This project is a task in the GUCMUN IEEE machine learning committee

## TASK
### In this task we'll train and select a multiclass classification model to predict whether a car's price is within one of five price categories.
* End-to-end machine learning on a classification problem
* Training multiclass classification models
* Making sense of confusion matrices and metrics to assess model performances
* Using K-Fold Cross Validation and do hyperparameter tuning with different models to select the best one

## Tool
Jupyter Notebooks
